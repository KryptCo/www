        <h1>What are Kryptonite and krd?</h1>
        <p>
            Kryptonite is an iOS and Android application that generates and stores a key pair for use with SSH (Secure Shell) and provides a mechanism to delegate access to the private key to computers running krd. The private key never leaves Kryptonite. Instead, through a pairing procedure, Kryptonite creates a channel for krd  to send “signature requests” whereby upon a valid request, Kryptonite cryptographically signs the requested data with the private key and only sends the resulting signature back to krd. This communication channel is encrypted and signed with a session key established during the pairing procedure.
        </p>

        <h2>Private Key Storage</h2>
        <p>
            On iOS, Kryptonite generates a 4096-bit RSA key pair using the Apple iOS Security framework or optionally an Ed25519 key pair using <a href="https://download.libsodium.org/doc/">libsodium</a>. Kryptonite stores the private key in the iOS Keychain with accessibility level “kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly”. To learn more about the security of Apple cryptography libaries and the Apple iOS Keychain see: https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf.
        </p>
		<p>
		On Android, Kryptonite generates a 3072-bit RSA key pair (because of the long secure hardware key generation time). The private key is stored in secure hardware called the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html">Android Keystore</a> and cannot be extracted, even by Kryptonite. The Android Keystore performs private key operations as a black box.
		</p>

        <h1>What information do we collect?</h1>
        <p>
            If analytics is enabled, we collect the following information about usage of the Kryptonite app:
            <ul>
                <li>App version</li>
                <li>iOS/Android Model, Version, Carrier, ISP</li>
                <li>Frequency of use for each app screen</li>
                <li>Frequency of approval requests</li>
                <li>Type of approval request: manual or automatic</li>
                <li>Latency of krd responses</li>
                <li>Whether a krd request times out</li>
                <li>General Location (City, State, Country)</li>
                <li>Email addresses (public key labels)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>What information do we <b>NOT</b> collect?</h1>
        <p>
            We do <b>NOT</b> collect any properties of your SSH communication. These are examples of things we <b>DO NOT</b> collect:
            <ul>
                <li>Private key</li>
                <li>SSH remote host names</li>
				<li>SSH remote host public keys</li>
				<li>SSH session ids</li>
                <li>SSH User names</li>
                <li>Computer names</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <h1>How do we collect information?</h1>
        <p>
            We report all collected information, except user email addresses, to Google Analytics by sending HTTP requests to the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol detailed at https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/. This data is governed by the Google privacy policy located at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. We do NOT use the Google Analytics iOS or Android SDKs. Every Kryptonite app generates a 128-bit random ID to be used only for analytics. User email addresses, along with the 128-bit analytics ID, are stored in Amazon Web Services’ DynamoDB Service, governed by the AWS privacy policy located at https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/. Using the email address and analytics ID stored in DynamoDB, KryptCo is able to associate a Google Analytics session to the corresponding user’s email address.
        </p>

        <h1>Disable information collection</h1>
        <p>
            Users can disable all information collection by navigating to the Kryptonite settings page and enabling the “Disable Google Analytics” setting. Kryptonite WILL report to Google Analytics that analytics have been disabled, but will not report any future events until analytics have been re-enabled by toggling the same setting.
        </p>


        <h1>How we use your information</h1>
        <p>
            We use your information to improve Kryptonite’s performance and quality. We use this information to learn which features are being used and how often. We also use this information to detect irregularities.  This enables us to modify functionality, diagnose potential bugs, and determine which features to select for product updates.
            <br/>
            We collect email addresses for the purpose of communicating new features, product updates, and company updates. We will never spam email addresses and provide users with a way to opt out.
