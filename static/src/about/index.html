				<h1>About KryptCo</h1>
                <p>
                    At KryptCo we’re building the next generation of mobile-based authentication. Our vision is that authentication should be based on strong cryptography.
                    <br><br>

                    Public key cryptography has existed for almost 40 years but it’s barely used for authentication. The private key is not memorizable. Most people cannot compute digital signatures in their head. Therefore we need to store the private key somewhere. It has to be accessible but also kept a secret. At KryptCo we’re tackling this very problem and we believe the smartphone is core to the solution.
                    <br><br>

                    Our first product, Kryptonite, is the new home for your SSH private key. The key never leaves your smartphone, but you can still use SSH from your computer as you normally would.
