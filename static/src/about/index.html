                <p>
                    At krypt.co we’re building the next generation of mobile-based authentication. Our vision is that authentication should be
                    based on strong cryptography.
                    <br>
                    <br> Public key cryptography has existed for almost 40 years but it’s barely used to authenticate people.
                    Most people cannot store a long private key in their head nor can they compute digital signatures on
                    the fly. Therefore, we need to store the private key somewhere. It has to be accessible but also kept
                    a secret. At krypt.co we’re tackling this very problem and we believe the smartphone is core to the solution.
                    <br>
                    <br> Our first product, Krypton Core, is the new home for your SSH private key. Krypton provides the best
                    of both worlds: the
                    <b>security</b> of having your private key
                    <em>never leave your phone</em> with the
                    <b>convenience</b> of using git and ssh as you normally do on your computer:
                    <code>git push</code> or
                    <code>ssh root@server</code>.
