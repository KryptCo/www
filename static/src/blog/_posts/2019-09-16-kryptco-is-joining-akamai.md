Krypton was born from the idea that strong, cryptographic authentication should also be easy to use. We initially built Krypton for iOS and Android to make it simple for developers to securely manage cryptographic keys for applications like SSH authentication and Git commit signing. We then expanded Krypton into the first hardware-less U2F and WebAuthn authenticator, to provide users on the web with accessible, unphishable zero-touch MFA.

**Today, we're happy to announce that krypt.co is joining Akamai!** Akamai is the leader in web security and secure enterprise access, and we're excited to leverage Krypton's technology in helping Akamai protect users on the web.

More updates to follow.
