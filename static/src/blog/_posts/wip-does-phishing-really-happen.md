I always wondered the same thing until I stumbled upon [phishtank.com](https://www.phishtank.com/). Phishtank is a great site for reporting scammers and it has a great community that verifies submissions. I believe that Google's safe-browsing APIs uses this site to learn about "deceptive" sites to automatically block for users. 

If you're curious I highly recommend (carefully) opening some of the submitted phishing sites and see for yourself just how real these attacks are. It's very likely that "popularsite.com" has a malicious cousin that was recently submitted to phishtank.

## Two-factor creds are getting phished!
What was not-so-surprising to see is that many of these phishing sites will also try to steal your second-factor authentication code.
