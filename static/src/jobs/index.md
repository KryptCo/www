# krypt.co is hiring!
krypt.co is a newly-funded startup born out of MIT and based in Boston. We're building the next generation of authentication, and we're starting with developers and engineering teams.
Security products should be built from the ground-up with strong cryptographic protocols, but cryptography alone is not enough -- it must be usable too. 
Our core values lie in the intersection of strong cryptography and breathtaking user experience. 

We released our first product, **Kryptonite**, for *free* in early May 2017. Kryptonite is the new home for every developer's SSH private key. Kryptonite provides the best of both worlds: the security of having your private key never leave your phone with the convenience of using `git` and `ssh` as you normally do on your computer: `git push` or `ssh root@server`.

Our next product builds on top of Kryptonite to provide a new level of security for every member of both small and large engineering teams.
How can big organizations trust krypt.co with their most sensitive internal software? Our answer is a `trustless`, `end-to-end verifiable` infrastructure. While companies depend on us exclusively for liveness, they need *not* trust krypt.co for the authenticity of their public data (like public keys, team membership, etc.) and privacy of their non-public data like audit logs.

Join us to change how engineers secure their keys, servers, and code repositories!

- stack: `rust`, `go`, `swift`, `java`, `javascript`.

## Open Positions

-----

### Platform Engineer
Without `kr` there's no Kryptonite. As our first platform engineer, you will be honing the workstation software that makes pairing Kryptonite with a computer seem like magic.
You will design, build, and deploy new features for `kr` which connects Kryptonite with core developer tools like `ssh` and `git`. 

*Platforms*: `macOS`, `Linux`, `Windows`

*Technologies*:
- `ssh`, `git`
- package managers (`brew`, `npm`, `apt`, `yum`, `aur`, etc)
- bluetooth low-energy
- AWS SQS/SNS
- PGP

*Languages*: `go`, `rust`

> **Requirements**: You have a knowledge of and/or interest in learning these platforms, technologies, and languages. It's a plus if you have deployed large-scale desktop software with a focus on stability and safety.

-----

### UX Engineer 
Usability and ease-of-use are just as important as security -- at krypt.co they are equal pillars. You will be responible for the design and user experience of every krypt.co product: the Kryptonite iOS and Android apps, the command line interface `kr`, and our upcoming *Teams* web dashboard. You will be the user advocate at every step of product development.

*Role*:
- build the Kryptonite for Teams web front-end
- use your favorite design tools to create mockup designs of user-flows on all of our product platforms
- create beautiful assets that echo Kryptonite's brand of simplicity and security
- turn user engagement data and feedback into product improvements

*Languages*: web front-end technologies

> **Requirements**: You have deployed web products all the way from the conception and design phase. You can start a future-proof codebase from scratch that will grow and withstand the test of time. You have extensive experience with JavaScript and know when to build something yourself versus use a framework.

-----

### iOS/Android Engineer
Transform the device that every developer carries in their pocket into a secure vault for their most powerful credential. You will be building technology that users directly interact with every time they push code or log into a server. Smoothness and reliability are top priorities.

*iOS*:
- `swift` 
- libraries: core bluetooth, core data, common crypto, security, notification content/service extensions
- concurrency (operation queues, mutexes, GCD)
- storyboard (interface builder, auto-layout)

*Android*:
- `Java`, Android Studio, JNI
- libraries: android keystore, ORMLite (sqlite), bluetooth
- fragments / constraint layouts

> **Requirements**: You have significant experience in at least one of these platforms and enjoy shipping safe, stable, and reliable phone apps. You published at least one app to the iOS or Android app store. It's a plus if you have worked on teams that have shipped large-scale iOS or Android apps.
