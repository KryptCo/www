# krypt.co is hiring!
krypt.co a small, well funded company born out of MIT and based in Boston. We're working on build the next generation of authentication, and we're starting with developers and engineering teams.
We believe security should be built from the ground-up with strong cryptogrphic protocols, but cryptography alone is not enough -- it must be usable too. 
Our core values lie in the interestion of strong cryptography and breathtaking user experience. 

We released our first product, **Kryptonite**, for *free* in early May 2017. Kryptonite, is the new home for every developer's SSH private key. Kryptonite provides the best of both worlds: the security of having your private key never leave your phone with the convenience of using `git` and `ssh` as you normally do on your computer: `git push` or `ssh root@server`.

Our next product builds on top of Kryptonite to provide world-class security for every member of both small and large engineering teams.
How can big organizations trust a small, new company with it's most sensitive internal software? Our answer is a `trustless`, `end-to-end verifiable` infrastructure. While companies minimally depend on us for liveness, they need *not* trust krypt.co for the authenticity of their public data (like public keys, team membership, etc) and privacy of their non-public data like audit logs.

Join us to change how engineers secure their keys, servers, and code repositories!

- stack: `rust`, `go`, `swift`, `java`, `javascript`.
