                                Why Kryptonite?
                            </div>

                                    Kryptonite combines the secure key storage of
                                    a USB smart card with a familiar mobile phone interface. The
                                    Kryptonite app performs SSH signatures without revealing the
                                    private key to a paired computer. A Kryptonite SSH key can be
                                    used without modifying any servers, allowing users to secure
                                    their GitHub, AWS, and Google Cloud SSH authentication without
                                    any changes to their infrastructure. Communication with
                                    Kryptonite occurs over encrypted and signed push notifications and
                                    Bluetooth, ensuring high availability and low latency.
                                    Kryptonite also verifies and displays exactly which server
                                    is being logged in to, unlike USB solutions that do not
                                    have a user interface.

                                    It is well known that users reuse passwords or small variations on passwords for different services, allowing a compromise of one to cause the compromise of many. Requiring users to remember highly random passwords for every different service is unreasonable, and many passwords are brute-forceable. Finally, passwords are annoying to type every time code is pushed or you login to a server.

                                Any application you run or install can silently read, use, and send off your private key without your knowledge. Kryptonite requires your explicit permission to use the private key and records every SSH access.

                                    A passphrase-encrypted key is decrypted upon entry of
                                    the password and given to a running SSH agent. A user-level process or malware
                                    can use a decrypted key stored in an agent without knowledge of the user.
                                    Furthermore, the same malware can pose as an SSH agent and direct SSH to use it
                                    using the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable, receiving the key in plaintext
                                    the first time it is used.

                            <div class='FAQ__question__answer'>
                                    Adding two-factor authentication to either password or public key authentication requires changes to every SSH server. Kryptonite works out of the box without any changes to a server. 
                                    
                                    In some cases, such as third-party hosted services (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.), integrating third-party two-factor is impossible. Many solutions require users to type a 6-digit passcode for every login, and others rely on a centralized server to perform the two-factor verification.

                                GitHub does not enforce two-factor authentication when you push or pull code with SSH. Using Kryptonite requires access to your phone to use the SSH key.

                                    With a smart cards you can generate and store SSH keys in a separate piece of
                                    hardware connected via USB. While the private key might not be extractable from the
                                    device, users now have to purchase and carry around another piece of hardware
                                    that takes up a USB port. Configuration of the smart card occurs on the
                                    workstation itself, which may be compromised. When you approve a
                                    signature, the only information conveyed to you is a blinking light, meaning
                                    you don't know what you're actually signing.

							On iOS, Kryptonite generates a 4096-bit RSA key pair using the Apple iOS Security framework or optionally an Ed25519 key pair using <a href="https://download.libsodium.org/doc/">libsodium</a>. Kryptonite stores the private key in the iOS Keychain with accessibility level “kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly”. To learn more about the security of Apple cryptography libaries and the Apple iOS Keychain see: <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf">https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf</a>.

							On Android, Kryptonite generates a 3072-bit RSA key pair (because of the long secure hardware key generation time). The private key is stored in secure hardware called the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html">Android Keystore</a> and cannot be extracted, even by Kryptonite. The Android Keystore performs private key operations as a black box.

							The role of a private key in an SSH login is to sign the SSH handshake. When a signature is required, your workstation calls out to Kryptonite running on the paired phone with the data that must be signed. If authorized, Kryptonite performs the signature using the private key and returns only the signature to the workstation.
