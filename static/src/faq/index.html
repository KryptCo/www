                            The simple answer is that you'll be able to login faster. No more typing 6-digit codes
                            or even reaching for your phone. Krypton securely takes care of providing your second factor.

                            Beyond convenience, you'll be immune to phishing. You don't have to worry that you're typing the code into the right website -- Krypton takes care of this for you under the hood. Krypton implements <a href="https://fidoalliance.org" target="_blank">FIDO U2F</a> to prevent phishing.

                            Yes, zero touch is safe. The security behind Krypton is established when you pair Krypton with your browser (via the extension) by scanning the QR code. This ensures that only your specific browser will be able talk to Krypton. Krypton and your browser establish a secure cryptographic channel using keys that only your phone and computer have. There is <strong>NO</strong> trusted third-party.

                            <br>
                            Two-factor is simply a way to defend against compromised passwords. If someone knows your password and attempts to login then they'll be hit with a second-factor challenge. Since this attacker is remote and doesn't have access to your browser they won't be able to talk to Krypton.

                            If someone malicious gets access to your computer or browser, they can do a lot of bad stuff like install a program to wait until you login to a site and then steal that browser session. No authentication mechanism can really prevent against this type of hacker.

                            Our mission is to help everyone be more secure on the web, including less technical people who don't understand or care about the differences between two-factor, U2F, or web authentication. Most 2FA authentications are stilling using SMS. They are not phishing proof, they are easy to compromise, and the UX is still pretty bad.

                            Krypton's value for most people will be that it's a "zero cognitive", "zero touch" way to do two-factor. Our hope is that because it's easier and a good experience, more people will adopt the technology that actually makes them more secure (U2F's phishing protections now and FIDO2/WebAuthn soon.)

                        <div class='FAQ__question__answer'>
                            Krypton is an invisible element that does not interact with other elements. 
                            In this way, Krypton is isolated and hidden, much how one should store secret data -- like a cryptographic private key. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We named our product Krypton Core because it represents the essential properties of the element Krypton and our threat model on how to store keys securely (isolation) and great usability by making it seamless to use (invisible).

                                    Why did we build Krypton Core?

                                        Krypton Core combines the secure key storage of
                                        a USB smart card with a familiar mobile phone interface. The
                                        Krypton app performs SSH signatures without revealing the
                                        private key to a paired computer. A Krypton SSH key can be
                                        used without modifying any servers, allowing users to secure
                                        their GitHub, AWS, and Google Cloud SSH authentication without
                                        any changes to their infrastructure. Communication with
                                        Krypton occurs over encrypted and signed push notifications and
                                        Bluetooth, ensuring high availability and low latency.
                                        Krypton also verifies and displays exactly which server
                                        is being logged in to, unlike USB solutions that do not
                                        have a user interface.

                                        It is well known that users reuse passwords or small variations on passwords for different services, allowing a compromise of one to cause the compromise of many. Requiring users to remember highly random passwords for every different service is unreasonable, and many passwords are brute-forceable. Finally, passwords are annoying to type every time code is pushed or you login to a server.

                                    Any application you run or install can silently read, use, and send off your private key without your knowledge. Krypton requires your explicit permission to use the private key and records every SSH access.

                                        A passphrase-encrypted key is decrypted upon entry of

                                        can use a decrypted key stored in an agent without knowledge of the user.
                                        Furthermore, the same malware can pose as an SSH agent and direct SSH to use it
                                        using the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable, receiving the key in plaintext

                                        Adding two-factor authentication to either password or public key authentication requires changes to every SSH server. Krypton works out of the box without any changes to a server. 
                                        
                                        In some cases, such as third-party hosted services (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.), integrating third-party two-factor is impossible. Many solutions require users to type a 6-digit passcode for every login, and others rely on a centralized server to perform the two-factor verification.

                                    GitHub does not enforce two-factor authentication when you push or pull code with SSH. Using Krypton requires access to your phone to use the SSH key.

                                        With a smart cards you can generate and store SSH keys in a separate piece of
                                        hardware connected via USB. While the private key might not be extractable from the
                                        device, users now have to purchase and carry around another piece of hardware
                                        that takes up a USB port. Configuration of the smart card occurs on the
                                        workstation itself, which may be compromised. When you approve a
                                        signature, the only information conveyed to you is a blinking light, meaning
                                        you don't know what you're actually signing.

                                The role of a private key in an SSH login is to sign the SSH handshake. When a signature is required, your workstation calls out to Krypton running on the paired phone with the data that must be signed. If authorized, Krypton performs the signature using the private key and returns only the signature to the workstation.

                                First make sure you remove the old SSH public key from any of your accounts. Once you have Krypton installed on your new phone, add the new public key to the accounts you were using SSH with before.

                                Krypton is an invisible, oderless chemical element that does not interact with other elements. 
                                In this way, Krypton is isolated and hidden, much how one should store secret data -- like a cryptographic private key.
