                <h1>Why Kryptonite?</h1>

                <p class="solution-title kr">
                    Kryptonite
                </p>
                <p class="solution-description kr">
                    Kryptonite combines the secure key storage of
                    a USB smart card with a familiar mobile phone interface. The
                    Kryptonite app performs SSH signatures without revealing the
                    private key to a paired computer. A Kryptonite SSH key can be
                    used without modifying any servers, allowing users to secure
                    their GitHub, AWS, and Google Cloud SSH authentication without
                    any changes to their infrastructure. Communication with
                    Kryptonite occurs over encrypted and signed push notifications and
					Bluetooth, ensuring high availability and low latency.
					Kryptonite also verifies and displays exactly which server
					is being logged in to, unlike USB solutions that do not
					have a user interface.

                <p class="solution-title">
                    Password-based authentication
                </p>
                <p class="solution-description">
                    It is well known that users reuse passwords or small variations on passwords for
                    different services, allowing a compromise of one to cause the compromise of
                    many. Requiring users to remember highly random passwords for every different
                    service is unreasonable, and many passwords are brute-forceable. Finally, passswords are
                    annoying to type every time code is pushed or you login to a server.
                </p>

                <p class="solution-title">
                    Public-key authentication
                </p>
                <p class="solution-description">
                    Public key authentication requires storage of a private key, and generally this
                    key is stored in plaintext in usersâ€™ home directories (~/.ssh). Any user-level
                    process or malware can read, use, and exfiltrate the private key without the
                    knowledge of the user. A passphrase-encrypted key is decrypted upon entry of
                    the password and given to a running SSH agent. A user-level process or malware
                    can use a decrypted key stored in an agent without knowledge of the user.
                    Furthermore, the same malware can pose as an SSH agent and direct SSH to use it
                    using the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable, receiving the key in plaintext
                    the first time it is used.
                </p>

                <p class="solution-title">
                    Two-factor authentication
                </p>
                <p class="solution-description">
                    Adding two-factor authentication to either password or public key
    				authentication requires changes to every SSH server. In some cases, such as
    				third-party hosted services (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.), integrating third-party
    				two-factor is impossible. Many solutions require users to type a 6-digit
    				passcode for every login, and others rely on a centralized server to perform
    				the two-factor verification.
                </p>

                <p class="solution-title">
                    Smart Cards
                </p>
                <p class="solution-description">
                    With a smart cards you can generate and store SSH keys in a separate piece of
                    hardware connected via USB. While the private key might not be extractable from the
                    device, users now have to purchase and carry around another piece of hardware
                    that takes up a USB port. Configuration of the smart card occurs on the
                    workstation itself, which may be compromised. When you approve a
                    signature, the only information conveyed to you is a blinking light, meaning
                    you don't know what you're actually signing.
